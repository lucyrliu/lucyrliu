Hey! My name is Lucy. I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Finance. I am also very involved with my school's Women in Computer Science club. I'm currently an AI/ML fellow at Cornell Breakthrough Tech, where I've developed supervised learning models for binary classification and linear regression, and neural network NLP models for sentiment analysis.
